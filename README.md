## Magic Eight Ball Application 

### Description

For this mini project I decided to create a fortune telling magic eight ball app. You input your name and ask a question, the app returns a random answer. This project was a marking point for me as it was the first time I configured the Javascript document object model fluently without looking at documentation. It showed me that my skills were improving and that I had reached a milestone and more holistic understanding of how to interconnect HTML and Javascript with query selectors.
